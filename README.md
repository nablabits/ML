## About
This is the repository I created during my personal journey throughout machine learning to nail down the concepts I found.

It's mainly designed for my personal use, however you might find it useful (and I'll be glad if you do!).

## Content
As of Aug 20, 2019 there is just one project (eventually the list will grow, though).
The following lines contain short descriptions for each of the projects (one for the moment). Inside them, there are broader explanations.

### Simple NN
This project is the implementation of a neural network that predicts the result of an `OR` operation between two elements, either 1 or 0.

## Installation
As of Aug 20, 2019 since there's only one project everything gets done by simply installing the dependencies in the requirements file in a virtual environment an then running each project with the instructions found inside its README.
