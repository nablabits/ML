## About
This is the repository I created during my personal learning journey throughout machine learning to nail down the concepts I found.

It's mainly designed for my personal use, however you might find it useful (and I'll be glad if you do!).

## Content
As of Oct 20, 2019 there are two projects (eventually the list will grow, though).
The following lines contain short descriptions for each of the projects. Inside them, there are broader explanations.

### Simple NN
This project is the implementation of a neural network created form the scratch that predicts the result of an `OR` operation between two elements, either 1 or 0.

### BCAM
During the 40th week of october I assisted to a 10h ML introductory course at the [Basque Center of Applied Mathematics](http://www.bcamath.org/en). Here's the content I collected so far.

## Installation
Everything gets done by simply installing the dependencies listed in the requirements file in a virtual environment

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
