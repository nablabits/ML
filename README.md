## About
This is the repository I created during my personal learning journey throughout machine learning to nail down the concepts I found.

It's mainly designed for my personal use, however you might find it useful (and I'll be glad if you do!).

## Content
As of Jul 21, 2020 there are several projects:

### Simple NN
This project is the implementation of a neural network created form the scratch that predicts the result of an `OR` operation between two elements, either 1 or 0.

### BCAM
During the 40th week of october I assisted to a 10h ML introductory course at the [Basque Center of Applied Mathematics](http://www.bcamath.org/en). Here's the content I collected so far.

### Bayesian inference
First steps on Bayes Theorem and bayesian inference.

### Kaggle
A hands on approach to ML, for the moment playing with Titanic Challenge

## Installation
Everything gets done by simply installing the dependencies listed in the requirements file in a virtual environment

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
